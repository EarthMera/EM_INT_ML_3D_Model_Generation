# Product 3D Modeling from Video using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

## Overview
This repository provides tools to extract video frames of a product shot from various angles and reconstruct a 3D model using **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**, specifically **instant-ngp** by NVlabs.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **instant-ngp**: For NeRF-based 3D reconstruction
